# Data Analyst Portfolio
### About Me
I am a chemical lab technician with a strong chemistry (M.S. Chemistry) and solid math background. After completing my Master's thesis in computational chemistry, I developed an interest in Python and machine learning. I enrolled in multiple data science bootcamps for both Python and R to start my self-teaching journey:

* [Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp with R](https://www.udemy.com/course/data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp-with-r/)
* [Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/)
* [The Complete Python Bootcamp from Zero to Hero](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-bootcamp/)

These courses served as the groundwork for my evolving interest in the field!

Fast forward and I've just completed my first semester in the Master of Science in Data Analytics program at Georgia Tech 🐝📚🔬 (OMSA) and am planning on completing the "C-track", or Computational Data Analytics, which focuses on Big Data and Machine Learning! My goal is to become a data analyst or data scientist in tech 🌐, physical sciences ⚛, or business 📈, specifically applying machine learning and AI 🤖.

In this repository, you can find some examples of my data analysis projects in Python, SQL, PowerBI, and R (my favorite). For more information about my background, please check out my [LinkedIn profile here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-bonfield-m-s-443843179/). I also have some "odds and ends" projects that involve Streamlit and NLP. They're FAR from polished but take it peak if it tickles your fancy.

A fun fact about me is I build my own wristwatches ⌚ Check out my watch page on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/protontimepieces/)
