# Data Analyst Portfolio
### About Me
I am a chemical lab technician with a strong chemistry background (M.S. Chemistry) trying to break into the field of data analytics and data science. What used to be a hobby interest of mine has transformed into attempting a career transition. I've just begun my Master of Science in Data Analytics program at Georgia Tech 🐝📚🔬 (OMSA) and have already found ways to implement my learnings on the job. I'm planning on completing the "C-track", or Computational Data Analytics, which focuses on Big Data and Machine Learning! My goal is to become a data analyst or data scientist in tech 🌐, physical sciences ⚛, or business 📈, specifically applying machine learning and AI 🤖.

In this repository, you can find some examples of my data analysis projects in Python, SQL, and R (my favorite). For more information about my background, please check out my [LinkedIn profile here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-bonfield-m-s-443843179/). I also have some "odds and ends" projects that involve Streamlit and NLP. They're FAR from polished but take it peak if it tickles your fancy.

A fun fact about me is I build my own wristwatches ⌚ Check out my watch page on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/protontimepieces/)
